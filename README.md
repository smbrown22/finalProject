# finalProject

Approach:

Since classes had to be utilized, you first had to construct the Task class. Variables would be added, then could be retrieved upon user input with the .value function. Adding the task isn't the difficult part however, the hardest part is making things work around it. Working with the checkboxes specifically was a trial to get through, because it wasn't just a button that could be pressed to initiate a function. They also aren't operating as boolean values, which makes them ten times more frustrating to deal with. 

Struggles: 

Event listeners just weren't working for me personally. I had to adapt and use onclick, by adding it as an attribute. Then I was able to utilize functions such as the taskDelete and taskDone function. 

Logging tasks was also a big deal that I was struggling with. 

And again, CHECKBOXES. They are incredibly silly in execution. They apparently don't automatically change value depending if they're checked or not. They're just always on. So, I had to readapt and force it to change values. 

While the project was a bit of a trial, it was definetly easier and less miserable than the midterm. So yay for that fr.
