# finalProject

Approach:

Since classes had to be utilized, you first had to construct the Task class. Variables would be added, then could be retrieved upon user input with the .value function. Adding the task isn't the difficult part however, the hardest part is making things work around it. Working with the checkboxes specifically was a trial to get through, because it wasn't just a button that could be pressed to initiate a function. They also aren't operating as boolean values, which makes them ten times more frustrating to deal with.

Mostly everything is contained in the taskAdd function, since that's what's doing most of the work. 

Struggles: 

Event listeners just weren't working for me personally. I had to adapt and use onclick, by adding it as an attribute. Then I was able to utilize functions such as the taskDelete and taskDone function to strikethrough and delete text. 

Logging tasks was also a big deal that I was struggling with. I ended up with an unfinished product here. 

And again, CHECKBOXES. You have to use a specific function rather than just evaluating the function as "true" or "false". 

While the project was a bit of a trial, it was definetly easier and less miserable than the midterm. I'll take what I can get.
